"""SQLite-backed leaky-bucket rate limiter for gas-sponsored actions.

This is the off-chain replacement for the retired on-chain
``SponsorshipRateLimiter`` contract. Metering lives here, in the sponsorship
webhook decision path, so the smart contracts no longer need a metered/unmetered
function split: the self-funded path is simply "the webhook declined to sponsor".

Model — linear leaky bucket, keyed by the zkPassport unique identifier so a human
shares one budget across registration and every forum, regardless of how many
addresses they control::

    usage_now = max(0, usage_last - leak_per_second * (now - updated_at))
    consume(weight): usage_now += weight; reject if usage_now > capacity

The bucket is denominated in **gas**: each sponsored userOperation costs the sum
of its gas-limit fields, so a human's budget tracks the compute actually
sponsored on their behalf rather than a coarse per-action approximation.

At the target scale (<= ~10k humans) a single SQLite file on a mounted volume is
ample. All access is serialized with a process-level lock and each operation runs
in its own short ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction under WAL, so a stray second
connection (e.g. a health check) cannot corrupt an in-flight read-modify-write.
